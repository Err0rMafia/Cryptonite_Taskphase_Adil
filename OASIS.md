Most of these challenges were solved as a team. Whoever contributed the most to the challenge submitted the flag for that challenge. We tried A LOT of hit and trails in most of these challenges(because we, like Jon Snow, **knew nothing** about solving these. This was our first CTF.) I don't remember most of the Hit and Trials but I have mentioned what I remember.

## Quence your thirst
THIS CHALLENGE WAS DONE COMPLETELY AS A TEAM. Everyone contributed equally. What i helped in: Deciphering the code and Combination of the website.
## Not Noice
First used the morsecode solving website used in earlier challanges but it didn't gave the flag. Used a different morsecode solving website that gave some image with it.
## Maze Runner
Reverse image search. The searched the location and Ideator(One mistake I remember is first putting creator's surname then realising it asked ideator's)
## Microsoft StrongEdge
Saw that there is no number in 1st page. Saw a dot there. Zoomed it. Solved the Cipher. Method that didn't worked: Converting to PDF, changing extensions, removing background etc
## Knock Knock
Used photoshop to easily repair the QR.
## BasiKEllY
Used a cipher solving website that solves for multiple ciphers at once.
## This or that?
Used a cipher solving website that solves for multiple ciphers at once.
## String me to sleep
Searched the text **OASIS{**
## Arte-Miss?
saw the solution to a similar challenge on youtube a long time ago ~~in a galaxy far far away~~ so knew what it was.
## Ready Player One?
Used a morsecode solving website

## Jekylle and Hide!
Tried finding the key using inspect element(couldn't becuase I didn't opened the links there). Tried searching the images of books to see if they have been edited in some way. Tried relating how the books are connected to each other(amazing book selection btw). Then one of my teammate(chiru) found the first part of the key. I , after that, found the second half of key(puting key in username and then followed along) but the contribution of Chiru was certainly more than mine so he submitted the key. 
## Keynough is enough
No contribution of mine. One of my teammate completely solved this on his own.
## Key-Key do you love me?
I and my teammates tried solving separately(to get it ASAP). Teammate solved it.
## Nom-Nom
Tried everywhere on inspect element to find but couldn't. Did a lot of hit and trials(even changing admin cookie to true but didn't refreshed the website). I wrecked my mind over this challenge. In the end my teammate single handedly solved it.
## Git Gud
Solved completely by my teammate.
