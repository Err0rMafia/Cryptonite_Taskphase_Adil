# The Root
## Procedure
pwn.college was already connected, so when I started the challenge Ubuntu opened right at the challenge. The challenge asked to open the file `run` that is located inside the directory `challenge` which is inside the root of filesystem `/`. so, I entered `/challenge/run`.
## Bash
`hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run`
`Correct!!!`
`/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:`
`pwn.college{4cCxHND_Q4g1KtdkFd9AejH7JB5.dVDN1QDLxgTN1czW}`
## Reference
pwn.college
