# The Root
## Procedure
pwm.college was already connected, so when I started the challenge Ubuntu opened right at the challenge and I did it as asked in pwn.college i.e by entering the path `/pwn` in which `/` is the root of the directory and `pwn` is the file that I needed to open.
## Bash
`hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Ee9Mr9Y7Sc54_CoUzrLeQtcc_SB.dhzN5QDLxgTN1czW}`
## Reference
pwn.college
